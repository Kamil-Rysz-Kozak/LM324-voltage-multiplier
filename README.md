# LM324-voltage-multiplier
Analog circuit in LTSpice for multiplying positive voltages and signals


# Requirements:

LM324 model for LTSpice, included in files


#Issues:

Currently, circuit works ALMOST as it should, except it distorts output signal noticeably. Maybe the reason why is wrong resistor values?
